# Longitudinal Wave Simulation 

## Description
An interactive web-based simulation that demonstrates the behavior of longitudinal waves using animated sine motion on an HTML5 canvas. Users can control wave width, speed, frequency, and height to visualize how vibrations move parallel to the direction of wave travel.

## Features
- Real-time animated longitudinal wave
- Adjustable wave parameters:
  - Wave Width
  - Wave Speed
  - Wave Frequency
  - Wave Height
- Clear visual representation of compression and rarefaction
- Theoretical explanation panel
- Simple and educational interface

## Technologies Used
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript  
- Canvas API  

## Concepts Covered
- Longitudinal wave motion  
- Wave frequency and amplitude  
- Direction of vibration  
- Sinusoidal wave representation  
- Interference basics  

## How to Run

1. Download the project files  
2. Open the HTML file in any web browser  
3. Adjust values and click **Update Wave**

(No installation required)

## Simulation Flow

Set Parameters → Update Wave → View Animation → Read Explanation  

## Educational Purpose
This simulation helps students understand longitudinal wave behavior through visual learning and interaction rather than static diagrams.

## Future Improvements
- Add compression particle animation  
- Include sound wave visualization  
- Mobile responsive design  
- Preset wave modes  

## Conclusion
This project provides a simple and interactive way to explore longitudinal wave concepts using modern web technologies.
